# Twitch-logger

  Logging Twitch Internet Relay Chat (IRC) using Sockets.
  
## TODO

- Integrate toxic chat detection model
- Play around w/ data analysis like:
  - which user commented the most
  - Impressions v/s time graph
  - which emote was most used
  - modCheck analysis etc . . .
- relay timeout bans to nightbot
- detect 'homomorphic' spams using regex and fuzzy matching
  
  GLHF :)
